Before the Human-Covenant war they were all scheduled to be dismantled due to a fault in the design of their reactors and sheer age, but now the few remaining ships have been pulled from the recycling lines and refitted with newer, more efficient reactors and a MAC Cannon.\nDespite their age these ships are very well armoured for their size and the refits have left them with extremely powerful engines.\n\n[Header]Mixing things up a bit\nThe way fighters work in vanilla FoC is the same as larger ships, build them and then slipspace them in, but in the Halo universe this just isn''t practical, fighters are just plain too small to support slipspace drives. It''s obvious that something needed to be done about this, so we''ve come up with a new way for fighters to work in CaW.\nInstead of slipping in new fighters they are built and deployed from fighter/bomber construction yards.\n[center][url=http://s228.photobucket.com/albums/ee259/Blamtroid/?action=view&curren;t=yard.png][img]http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee259/Blamtroid/yard.png[/img][/url][/center]\nA maximum on 2 fighter stations and 1 bomber station can be on the field and each station can only have 5 active squadrons at any one time.\nThese stations can be placed anywhere normal reinforcments can, Covenant players may want to consider finding and eliminating the UNSC''s fighter bases before surging forward to deliver the final blow.\n\n[Header]Putting it all together\nHere''s some new screenshots with the new stuff ingame for you:\n<div class="center">[url=http://www.moddb.com/mods/halo-covenant-at-war/images/apex-studios-update-230120115][img]http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/mods/1/11/10520/thumb_300x150/sweawfoc-20110116-190352.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://www.moddb.com/mods/halo-covenant-at-war/images/apex-studios-update-230120114][img]http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/mods/1/11/10520/thumb_300x150/sweawfoc-20110121-124324.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.moddb.com/mods/halo-covenant-at-war/images/apex-studios-update-230120113][img]http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/mods/1/11/10520/thumb_300x150/sweawfoc-20110121-124728.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://www.moddb.com/mods/halo-covenant-at-war/images/apex-studios-update-230120112][img]http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/mods/1/11/10520/thumb_300x150/sweawfoc-20110123-183935.jpg[/img][/url]\n[url=http://www.moddb.com/mods/halo-covenant-at-war/images/apex-studios-update-230120111][img]http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/mods/1/11/10520/thumb_300x150/sweawfoc-20110123-184515.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://www.moddb.com/mods/halo-covenant-at-war/images/apex-studios-update-23012011][img]http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/mods/1/11/10520/thumb_300x150/sweawfoc-20110116-170007.jpg[/img][/url]</div>\n[Header]Enough from me...\nAnh''s got something really cool lined up for you, read on to see what he''s been up to in the last few weeks.\n[i]/end file/[/i]\n\n[b]United Nations Space Command  PR-TRANSMISSION 44877Z-00[/b]\n[b]Encryption  Code:[/b] Orange\n[b]Public Key:[/b] file /charlie-three-six-nine/\n[b]From:[/b] [i]>>FLEETCOM.MO.ANHNHAN[/i]\n[b]To:[/b] [i]>>CAWCOM[/i]\n[b]Subject:[/b] SITREP\n[b]Classification:[/b] Restricted\n\n[i]/start file/[/i] \n<span class="bigletter">H</span>ey guys,\nyou all know that today is a special day for H:CaW: It''s our birthday. And our world has an interesting tradition. I found out that every time a company or something else that is not a single person has their birthday, they are *giving* out the presents to the people although they are supposed to *accept* the presents. So yeah, I don''t want to break that nonsense tradition now. But later, as I have other things to do. P.S.: No, it''s not a demo.\n\n[Header]Chapter 1: Behind the scenes\nNot that you mistake me in any way: You are not getting a peep at what''s behind the scenes. It''s rather that I only have been doing things not really noticeable to the public and thus not being able to show anything to our precious community. Yes, little reader, I was talking about you. I''m sure that you are not interested in how I unintentionally single-handed blew up the whole balancing in the mod by preventing the UNSC (W00T!) Frigate from launching its missiles. You also don''t want to know how I increased the shields of the Covenant Destroyer or how I removed one of the two energy projectors from the Assault Carrier. And you don''t want to know how easy certain Covenant ships were being cracked. Tip: Easier than nuts.\nI don''t want to tell you uninteresting things to keep you interested, it will just bore you off and hence won''t work. Instead, I will tell you that I had lied. I do something for you guys. Incredible, isn''t it?\n\n[Header]Chapter 2: Lying out of fun\nPlease do me a favor first: Never belie out of fun. It''s uncool, especially when you get addicted to it. Get addicted to Halo instead, it''s better. And RTS, too. Halo Wars tried to combine both, but you see what it became. So it''s our turn now.

Fast-paced and yet tactical action, insane graphics (I agree that *sometimes* the ships are too dark, but the game has an inbuilt brightness setting, you can have it how you want) and a completely new way of gameplay. You won''t just rush into the enemy base, but instead you will have a hard time defending first, becoming extremely excited thanks to the adrenaline, and savoring the high amount of mirth when finally destroying the enemy star base.\n\n[Header]Chapter 3: Ultimate Victory\nWinning is like beer.

Before the Human-Covenant war they were all scheduled to be dismantled due to a fault in the design of their reactors and sheer age, but now the few remaining ships have been pulled from the recycling lines and refitted with newer, more efficient reactors and a MAC Cannon.<br />\nDespite their age these ships are very well armoured for their size and the refits have left them with extremely powerful engines.<br /><h2>Mixing things up a bit</h2>The way fighters work in vanilla FoC is the same as larger ships, build them and then slipspace them in, but in the Halo universe this just isn''t practical, fighters are just plain too small to support slipspace drives. It''s obvious that something needed to be done about this, so we''ve come up with a new way for fighters to work in CaW.<br />\nInstead of slipping in new fighters they are built and deployed from fighter/bomber construction yards.<br />\n<div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://s228.photobucket.com/albums/ee259/Blamtroid/?action=view&curren;t=yard.png"><img src="http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee259/Blamtroid/yard.png" alt="User Posted Image" /></a></div><br />\nA maximum on 2 fighter stations and 1 bomber station can be on the field and each station can only have 5 active squadrons at any one time.<br />\nThese stations can be placed anywhere normal reinforcments can, Covenant players may want to consider finding and eliminating the UNSC''s fighter bases before surging forward to deliver the final blow.<br /><h2>Putting it all together</h2>Here''s some new screenshots with the new stuff ingame for you:<br />\n<div class="center"><a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/halo-covenant-at-war/images/apex-studios-update-230120115"><img src="http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/mods/1/11/10520/thumb_300x150/sweawfoc-20110116-190352.jpg" alt="User Posted Image" /></a><a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/halo-covenant-at-war/images/apex-studios-update-230120114"><img src="http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/mods/1/11/10520/thumb_300x150/sweawfoc-20110121-124324.jpg" alt="User Posted Image" /></a><br />\n<a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/halo-covenant-at-war/images/apex-studios-update-230120113"><img src="http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/mods/1/11/10520/thumb_300x150/sweawfoc-20110121-124728.jpg" alt="User Posted Image" /></a><a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/halo-covenant-at-war/images/apex-studios-update-230120112"><img src="http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/mods/1/11/10520/thumb_300x150/sweawfoc-20110123-183935.jpg" alt="User Posted Image" /></a><br />\n<a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/halo-covenant-at-war/images/apex-studios-update-230120111"><img src="http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/mods/1/11/10520/thumb_300x150/sweawfoc-20110123-184515.jpg" alt="User Posted Image" /></a><a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/halo-covenant-at-war/images/apex-studios-update-23012011"><img src="http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/mods/1/11/10520/thumb_300x150/sweawfoc-20110116-170007.jpg" alt="User Posted Image" /></a></div><br /><h2>Enough from me...</h2>Anh''s got something really cool lined up for you, read on to see what he''s been up to in the last few weeks.<br />\n<i>/end file/</i><br />\n<br />\n<b>United Nations Space Command  PR-TRANSMISSION 44877Z-00</b><br />\n<b>Encryption  Code:</b> Orange<br />\n<b>Public Key:</b> file /charlie-three-six-nine/<br />\n<b>From:</b> <i>>>FLEETCOM.MO.ANHNHAN</i><br />\n<b>To:</b> <i>>>CAWCOM</i><br />\n<b>Subject:</b> SITREP<br />\n<b>Classification:</b> Restricted<br />\n<br />\n<i>/start file/</i> <br />\n<span class="bigletter">H</span>ey guys,<br />\nyou all know that today is a special day for H:CaW: It''s our birthday. And our world has an interesting tradition. I found out that every time a company or something else that is not a single person has their birthday, they are *giving* out the presents to the people although they are supposed to *accept* the presents. So yeah, I don''t want to break that nonsense tradition now. But later, as I have other things to do. P.S.: No, it''s not a demo.<br /><h2>Chapter 1: Behind the scenes</h2>Not that you mistake me in any way: You are not getting a peep at what''s behind the scenes. It''s rather that I only have been doing things not really noticeable to the public and thus not being able to show anything to our precious community. Yes, little reader, I was talking about you. I''m sure that you are not interested in how I unintentionally single-handed blew up the whole balancing in the mod by preventing the UNSC (W00T!) Frigate from launching its missiles. You also don''t want to know how I increased the shields of the Covenant Destroyer or how I removed one of the two energy projectors from the Assault Carrier. And you don''t want to know how easy certain Covenant ships were being cracked. Tip: Easier than nuts.<br />\nI don''t want to tell you uninteresting things to keep you interested, it will just bore you off and hence won''t work. Instead, I will tell you that I had lied. I do something for you guys. Incredible, isn''t it?<br /><h2>Chapter 2: Lying out of fun</h2>Please do me a favor first: Never belie out of fun. It''s uncool, especially when you get addicted to it. Get addicted to Halo instead, it''s better. And RTS, too. Halo Wars tried to combine both, but you see what it became. So it''s our turn now.
